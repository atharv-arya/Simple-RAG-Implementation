RAG Implementation

This repository contains a basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model that retrieves questions from a knowledge base for a side project inspired by the game "Psych." Currently, questions.pdf holds 10 sample questions, but itâ€™s scalable for larger datasets. The model is flexible, enabling customized content retrieval to suit various data and use cases beyond trivia.
